I was the lead engineer for this project which focused on PoE and Smart Building Deployments for the Cisco 9000 Series.

Storage Area Networks (SAN) are dedicated high-speed networks that allow devices to access large amounts of data. As high-performance all-flash and NVMe storage arrays are connected to Fibre Channel SANs, the issue of congestion and slow drain is becoming a bigger problem, resulting in the need for enhanced techniques to identify, correct and prevent SAN congestion.

The CiscoÂ® MDS 9000 Series directors and switches provide a solution to correct this problem with its Dynamic Ingress Rate Limiting (DIRL) software, a new innovation that identifies and prevents SAN congestion. SAN congestion caused by slow drain and over-utilization, is prevented by the MDS DIRL software with no impact on the target device and other connected devices.
